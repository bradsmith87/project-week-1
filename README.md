# Group Project



An analysis of Australian dining habits using data from Zomato, Gourmet Traveller and the Good Food Guide.



Team Members: Mickey Sandhu, Brad Smith and Nelson Paulo Balino



Proposal: This project analyses dining habits in three Australian cities (Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth). We will focus on two types of analysis: popularity and correlation. In particular the following questions will be posited;

1. Most popular restaurants in each city according to Zomato
2. Most popular cuisines in each city according to Zomato
3. Top cuisines and restaurants in Australia according to Zomato
4. Top restaurants in Australia according to Gourmet Traveller (2019)
5. Top restaurants in Australia according to Good Food Guide (2020)
6. Whether there is any similarities between popular restaurants according to Zomato reviewers and those judged Australia's finest by Gourmet Traveller (2019) and Good Food Guide Awards (2020)
