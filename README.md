2.	Most popular cuisines in each city according to Zomato
3.	Top cuisines and restaurants in Australia according to Zomato 
4.	Top cuisines and restaurants in Australia according to Gourmet Traveller (2019)
5.	Whether there is any similarities between popular restaurants according to Zomato and those judged Australia's finest by Gourmet Traveller (2019)
